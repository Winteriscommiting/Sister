# Sister — Static Memory Game

This is a simple, static web project: a welcome page that asks for a name and a memory card-matching game. Open the HTML directly in your browser—no build tools or servers are required.

Pages

- `index.html` — Welcome/name entry; routes to the game with `?n=`
- `index6.html` — Memory game with moves/time HUD and a celebration overlay

Notes

- Name is remembered locally via `localStorage` and query string; there is no online database.
- Designed to be lightweight and work offline.

How to run

- Double-click `index.html` or `index6.html` to open in your browser.
